This repository contains the code used in my Bachelor's thesis project. It is based primarily on the following paper:

Zero-Shot Learning Through Cross-Modal Transfer. Richard Socher, Milind Ganjoo, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Y. Ng. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2013).

Dataset used: CIFAR10 (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
